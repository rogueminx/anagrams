#### Behavior
1. Asks user for two words or phrases, informs user if they are anagrams regardless of capitilization or spacing.
  * example input: "A Bar Potty" "partyboat"
  * example output: "Yes, 'A Bar Potty' is an anagram of 'partyboat'!"
2. Asks user for two words or phrases, informs user if they are antigrams regardless of capitilization or spacing.
  * example input: "pry" "ask"
  * example output: "That's no anagram, but 'ask' is an antigram of 'pry'!"
3. Asks user for two words or phrases, informs user if they aren't words. Only checks to make sure there are vowels. 
  * example input: "prp" "ask"
  * example output: "Um, 'prp' isn't a word, dummy."
